    "Welcome to this tutorial on working with Large Language Models (LLMs). We'll explore how to effectively use these powerful AI systems through the OpenAI API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized how we interact with AI systems. There are three key concepts that make these models particularly powerful:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompting**: The art of effectively communicating with LLMs through carefully crafted inputs. This includes techniques like few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and system messages that help guide the model's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function Calling**: A powerful capability that allows LLMs to interact with external tools and APIs. By defining functions that the model can \"call\", we can create applications that combine the model's intelligence with real-world actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Structured Outputs**: The ability to get responses in specific formats (JSON, XML, etc.) makes it easier to integrate LLMs into existing systems and ensure consistent, parseable outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the OpenAI API, we'll explore these concepts through practical examples and demonstrate how they can be combined to create powerful applications."

    "You can get an API key by following these steps:\n",
    "1. [Create a new project](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9186755-managing-your-work-in-the-api-platform-with-projects)\n",

      "   J = 2j\n",
      "   \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The second condition states that \"Four years ago, Jack was three times as old as Jill.\" We need to express their ages four years ago:\n",
      "\n",
      "   - Jack's age four years ago: \\( J - 4 \\)\n",
      "   - Jill's age four years ago: \\( j - 4 \\)\n",

    "Throughout this tutorial, we explored the fundamental techniques for effectively working with Large Language Models (LLMs) using the OpenAI API:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompting** – Crafting effective inputs to guide the model’s behavior, including few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and system messages.  \n",
    "- **Function Calling** – Enabling LLMs to interact with external APIs, tools, and databases by generating structured function calls.  \n",
    "- **Structured Outputs** – Ensuring LLM responses are machine-readable (e.g., JSON, XML) for seamless integration into applications.  \n",

    "### **1. Memory in LLMs**  \n",
    "Persisting past interactions to create more personalized, context-aware AI responses.  \n",
    "- *Example:* Enabling a chatbot to remember user preferences across multiple conversations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  \n",
    "Enhancing LLMs with external knowledge sources for more factual and up-to-date answers.  \n",
    "- *Example:* Using a vector database like **FAISS** to retrieve relevant documents before generating a response.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Fine-Tuning Models**  \n",
    "Training LLMs on domain-specific data to improve performance in specialized tasks.  \n",
    "- *Example:* Fine-tuning an LLM on **legal documents** to generate more precise legal summaries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. AI Agents & Multi-Step Reasoning**  \n",
    "Using LLMs to plan and execute multi-step tasks, interacting with various APIs or tools.  \n",
    "- *Example:* An AI that can book flights, find hotels, and schedule events in a single workflow.  \n",
